# Analyzing Heart Disease using Machine Learning techniques
A mini project on analyzing whether the patient has heart disease or not.
 K â€“Nearest Neighbour (KNN) , Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine(SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest has been used to evaluate the accuracy.

I have used the Heart Disease dataset from UCI. The dataset contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

age

sex

chest pain type (4 values)

resting blood pressure

serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

# Analyzing Heart Disease using Machine Learning techniques
A mini project on analyzing whether the patient has heart disease or not.
 K –Nearest Neighbour (KNN) , Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine(SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest has been used to evaluate the accuracy.

The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease dataset taken from UCI. The dataset contains 76 attributes, but for the project purpose I have only used 14 columns. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

### Attribute Information:

1.age: displays the age of the individual.

2.sex: displays the gender of the patient. 

   - 1 = male
   
   - 0 = female

3.chest pain type (4 values): displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the patient
				- 1 = typical angina
    - 2 = atypical angina
				- 3 = non — anginal pain
				- 4 = asymptotic

4.resting blood pressure

5.serum cholestoral in mg/dl

6.fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

7.resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

8.maximum heart rate achieved

9.exercise induced angina

10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

11.the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

12.number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

13.thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
